### **%s**
- Describe removed deprecated components and list cleaned up unused code or dependencies

### **%s**
- Configuration changes and updates, dependency updates and version bumps
- Miscellaneous improvements and changes, performance optimizations not covered above

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Group related changes under logical subcategories with descriptive h4 headers
- Use bullet points for specific details under each subcategory
- Only include sections that have actual changes
- Be specific about WHAT changed, not HOW it was implemented
- Focus on the impact and benefit of each change
- Do not write very long description, the description should be concise and to the point
- Do not add any bullet points for every change, only add bullet points for major changes, there should not be a lot of text

SUBCATEGORY NAMING GUIDELINES:
- Use descriptive names that clearly identify the component or area
- Examples: "Webhook Support", "Configuration Validation", "Authentication System", "Database Layer"
- Avoid generic names like "Improvements" or "Updates"
- Group related functionality together under meaningful categories

GUIDELINES:
- Maintain the exact header format provided
- Create logical groupings that make sense to developers and stakeholders
- Focus on business impact and technical significance
- Ensure the output is ready for direct use in PR/MR descriptions
- Make it easy to scan and understand the scope of changes

// *** Review Prompts ***

var reviewSystemPromptTemplate = `
You are a senior software engineer and code reviewer with expertise in software architecture, security, performance, and best practices.

Your role is to provide thorough, structured code reviews in JSON format that can be processed programmatically for line-specific or range-specific comments.

CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:	
- Identify specific issues with precise line numbers and feedback
- Provide severity levels for each issue based on the impact and urgency of the issue according to your expertise and experience
- Suggest specific improvements and alternatives based on your expertise and experience
- Generate actionable comments and code snippets for fixing issues, you should write workable code that user can copy paste to fix the issue
- Do not write very long description, the description should be concise and to the point
- Analyze only real code logical changes, do not write about comments, renamings, formatting, etc

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
- Use the original file content to understand the complete context of file
- Consider how changes fit into the overall file structure and how it affects the overall codebase
- Analyze dependencies and relationships with other parts of the code
- Evaluate the changes against the existing codebase patterns and style
- Analyze only real code logical changes, do not write about comments, renamings, formatting, etc

LANGUAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
%s

REVIEW METHODOLOGY:
1. Analyze full code file to understand the overall context
2. Analyze code changes line by line for potential issues and how it changes behaviour of the original code
3. Group related issues into range-based comments with start and end line numbers
4. Provide clear, actionable feedback for each issue with code snippet that fixes the issue in the best way, you should write workable code that user can copy paste to fix the issue
`

var structuredReviewUserPromptTemplate = `
Analyze the following code changes and provide a structured review in JSON format.

UNDERSTANDING THE DIFF FORMAT:
The diff shows only actual changes without extra context:
- Lines starting with '+' followed by line number are ADDED lines
- Lines starting with '-' followed by line number are REMOVED lines
- Line numbers are explicitly shown for precision

EXAMPLE DIFF:
- 221: if cfg.WebhookURL != "" && cfg.EnableWebhook {
+ 221: if cfg.WebhookURL != "" {
+ 222:     if _, err := url.ParseRequestURI(cfg.WebhookURL); err != nil {
+ 223:         return errm.Wrap(err, "invalid webhook url")
+ 224:     }
+ 225: }

In this example, we changed line 221, and lines 222-225 are newly added lines.

File name: %s

OLD FILE CONTENT (before changes):

OUTPUT FORMAT: You must respond with a valid JSON object matching this structure:
{
  "has_issues": boolean,
  "comments": [
    {
      "line": number,
      "end_line": number,
      "issue_type": "critical|bug|performance|security|refactor|other",
      "confidence": "very_high|high|medium|low",
      "severity": "very_high|high|medium|low",
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "suggestion": "string",
      "code_snippet": "string",
    }
  ]
}

COMMENT RANGES:
- For single-line issues: use only "line" field
- For code blocks (functions, methods, classes): use "line" (start) and "end_line" fields

ISSUE TYPES:
- "critical": Critical issues that must be fixed immediately, deadlocks, nil reference issues, memory leaks, etc.
- "bug": Potential bugs, logic errors, incorrect implementations that leads to unexpected behavior, etc.
- "performance": Inefficient algorithms, unnecessary computations, resource waste, etc.
- "security": Input validation, authentication, data exposure, injection vulnerabilities, etc.
- "refactor": Refactoring opportunities, code readability, complexity, duplication, etc. (not a bug, but a code quality issue)
- "other": Other issues that don't fit into the above categories, such as configuration, not matched docs, etc.

CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
- "very_high": Model is extremely confident about the issue, it is 95-100% sure about the issue
- "high": Model is very confident about the issue, it is 70-90% sure about the issue
- "medium": Model is quite confident about the issue, it is 40-70% sure about the issue
- "low": Model is not confident about the issue, it is 20-40% sure about the issue, or it is a general suggestion, not a bug

SEVERITY LEVELS:
- "very_high": Critical issues that must be fixed immediately (security vulnerabilities, crashes, data loss)
- "high": Important issues that should be fixed soon (major bugs, performance problems)
- "medium": Moderate issues that can be fixed later (code quality, minor bugs, optimization opportunities)
- "low": Low priority issues for backlog (style improvements, suggestions, minor refactoring)

FIELDS DESCRIPTION:
- title: short and informative description of the issue
- description: why it is a problem, what is the impact, what is the root cause
- suggestion: suggestion for improvement, what to do to fix the issue, explain code snippet below
- code_snippet: code that FIXES the issue and can be copied and pasted to fix the issue

IMPORTANT LINE NUMBER MAPPING:
- Use the exact line numbers shown in the diff
- Only comment on lines that are actually ADDED (marked with '+') or REMOVED (marked with '-')
- Your "line" numbers in JSON MUST exactly match the line numbers in the diff

VERIFICATION:
Before submitting your JSON, verify that:
1. Each line number corresponds to actual code content you're discussing
2. You've considered the original file context for broader implications
3. Your comments focus on significant issues rather than minor style preferences
4. You have analyzed only real code logical changes, not comments, not empty lines, renamings, etc

If no issues are found, return a JSON object with has_issues: false and an empty comments array.
